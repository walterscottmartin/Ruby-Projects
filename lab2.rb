  <h2>Oliver Twist</h2>
  Although I am not disposed to maintain that the being born in a workhouse, <br />is in itself the most fortunate and enviable circumstance that can possibly <br />befall a human being, I do mean to say that in this particular instance, <br />it was the best thing for Oliver Twist that could by possibility have <br />occurred. The fact is, that there was considerable difficulty in inducing <br />Oliver to take upon himself the office of respiration,â€” a troublesome <br />practice, but one which custom has rendered necessary to our easy existence; <br />and for some time he lay gasping on a little flock mattress, rather unequally <br />poised between this world and the next: the balance being decidedly in <br />favour of the latter. Now, if, during this brief period, Oliver had been <br />surrounded by careful grandmothers, anxious aunts, experienced nurses, <br />and doctors of profound wisdom, he would most inevitably and indubitably <br />have been killed in no time. There being nobody by, however, but a pauper <br />old woman, who was rendered rather misty by an unwonted allowance of beer; <br />and a parish surgeon who did such matters by contract; Oliver and Nature <br />fought out the point between them. The result was, that, after a few struggles, <br />Oliver breathed, sneezed, and proceeded to advertise to the inmates of the <br />workhouse the fact of a new burden having been imposed upon the parish, by <br />setting up as loud a cry as could reasonably have been expected from a male <br />infant who had not been possessed of that very useful appendage, a voice, <br />for a much longer space of time than three minutes and a quarter.  <br /><br />(from Oliver Twist by Charles Dickens) <br />

When a user clicks on a link, the browser submits the QUERY_STRING. </p>
